## RAG for Wikipedia Q&A (Zinedine Zidane)  

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that scrapes **Wikipedia's "Zinedine Zidane" page** and allows users to ask questions about him.

##

The system retrieves relevant information from the Wikipedia article and generates responses using OpenAI's **GPT-4o-mini**.

## Features  

1. **Wikipedia Scraping** ‚Äì Extracts content from Zidane's Wikipedia page.  
2. **Text Chunking & Indexing** ‚Äì Splits and stores content for efficient retrieval (vector database).  
3. **Interactive Q&A** ‚Äì Users can ask questions in a chat-like format.  
4. **Context-Aware Responses** ‚Äì Provides relevant answers based on retrieved documents.  
5. **Exit Option** ‚Äì Users can type "exit" to quit the chat.

## How It Works  

**Web Scraping**: Loads Zidane's Wikipedia page and extracts the main content.  
**Text Processing**: Splits the content into chunks for better indexing.  
**Vector Storage**: Stores processed text using OpenAI embeddings.  
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation**:  
  - Retrieves relevant text chunks based on the user's question.  
  - Uses GPT-4o-mini to generate answers from the retrieved content.  
**Interactive Chat**: Users can ask multiple questions and receive real-time responses.

## Setup & Installation  

### Install Dependencies  
Ensure you have Python and the required packages installed:  

```bash
pip install langchain langchain_openai langchain_core langchain_community bs4
```

### Set Your OpenAI API Key  
Before running, set your OpenAI API key:  

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"
```
-> you can copy/paste it in a chat-box style.

### Run the Script  
Start the interactive Q&A system:  

```bash
python script.py
```

## Usage Example  

```bash
Give us your question! I am stronger if we talk about Zidane ‚öΩÔ∏è.

‚ùì Your question: Why did Zidane retire?
üí° Answer: Too painful to answer...
```

To exit, simply type **"exit"**.

## Resources  

The main basis for the work was:
- **LangChain RAG Guide**: [LangChain RAG Tutorial](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/)

The useful resources were:
- **Wikipedia API**: [LangChain Wikipedia Loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/wikipedia/)  
- **Vector Stores**: [LangChain VectorStores](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/vectorstores/)  

---

## Notes  

- If the system doesn‚Äôt find an answer, it will return:  
  *"I don't know based on the provided corpus."*  
- This system is optimized for questions about Zidane, but can be modified for other topics.  

---

## Future Improvements  

- **Expand to multiple football players**  
- **Enhance document retrieval accuracy**  
- **Multi-language support**  

---

Zizou.
